        Updates from SVN through r26:
        * Allow entering Unicode blocks greater than 0xFFFF.
        * Fixed multiple stroke inputs not working in the latest version of
          Ubuntu.
        * Updated email address.
        * Removed GNOME dependency in favor of gtk_show_uri(). Without GNOME or
          GTK 2.14 you just won't get the "help" button.
        * Turkish translation for Desktop file (thanks ozbekanil!).
        * Turn on window hints if struts are on, this seems to help people with
          certain window managers (thanks Ronald)
        * Fix for Korean languages
        * Key text is now always white
        * Window struts fix on 64-bit machines (thank you Huang Ying!)
        * Add explicit libx11 dependency for binutils-gold
        * Possible fix for profile not being saved correctly. Return code was
          not being correctly checked.
        * Added --ignore-fifo option to force starting a second instance.
        * Sticky keys (shifts) now activate when the mouse pointer is outside of
          the keyboard area so you can shift-click in GIMP etc.
        * Removed 1hz polling of fifo, now checks for input using a GLib watch
          (thanks to Thomas Jaeger for the patch!)
        * CellWriter will toggle the main window when a second instance is
          started instead of forcing the window to show. The --show-window and
          --hide-window arguments can be used to force the window to show or
          hide respectively. Thanks to Mattias Runge for the suggestion that
          this was needed.

        * Revision 1.3.5

2008-05-28  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * stroke.c, averages.c: Fixed two memory leaks
        * Revision 1.3.4

2008-01-25  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * main.c: The standard library rename() function can't handle moving
          across filesystems, this prevented the profile from being saved
          correctly -- created a new function, move_file(), to handle this
          case
        * Revision 1.3.3

2008-01-24  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * cellwidget.c: Pango does not properly cleanup a FreeType Font Map
          object, this was causing a really nasty memory leak. CellWriter did
          not need to recreate the Font Map on every configure event, however,
          and removing this fixed the leak.
        * cellwidget.c, keywidget.c, options.c: Style colors are now available
          with GTK versions prior to 2.10. Should no longer get a black
          background for the keyboard.
        * main.c: Profiles are saved more carefully now -- a temporary file is
          written first and then moved in place of the old profile
        * Revision 1.3.2

2007-11-22  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * cellwidget.c: Hold-click timeouts are no longer interrupted by other
          timeouts and do not restart when the pointer is moved
        * cellwidget.c: Timeouts are now half a second long
        * options.c: Grid width limit raised to 48
        * cellwidget.c, keywidget.c, keyevent.c: Keyboard mappings are now
          updated before any key events are sent to catch any changes

2007-10-30  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * main.c: Fixed a crash bug in a logging function (how typical...)
        * main.c: Make sure the program folder exists before trying to create
          the FIFO
        * keywidget.c: Keyboard size now has a non-zero default
        * main.c, common.h: Replaced some g_debug() calls with the new trace()
          function that only prints at log level 8
        * window.c, cellwidget.c: Docked window now fills the entire width of
          the screen and leaves enough room for the scrollbar
        * Revision 1.3.1

2007-10-29  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * statusicon.c: Left-click status icon menu no longer on by default
        * window.c, cellwidget.c: Added back buffer button to recall previously
          entered input
        * main.c: Include for errno.h was missing (probably was nested in
          libgnome.h)
        * window.c, keywidget.c, cellwidget.c, options.c: Disabled use of
          style colors in GTK 2.8 compilation
        * window.c, main.c: New option --xid allows CellWriter to embed within
          gnome-screensaver, see:
          http://live.gnome.org/GnomeScreensaver/FrequentlyAskedQuestions
          #head-5196776d04ed41242da63723d837fa188d57693a
        * window.c, options.c: The main window can now be docked to either the
          top or the bottom of the screen. A new setup window and command-
          line option (--dock-window=#) control this behavior.
        * window.c, main.c: Can't figure out how to move the window within
          its own struts with Metacity, going to leave it as an extra command-
          line switch (--window-struts)
        * main.c, singleinstance.c: CellWriter will now watch for input from
          its fifo and react accordingly (see README)
        * Unstable version 1.3.0

2007-10-14  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * keyevent.c: Adding 1ms delay to XTestFakeKeyEvent() fixes mixed up
          order on AMD64 Gentoo (thanks Stefan Baur!)
        * window.c: Help label colors are taken from tooltip style
        * keywidget.c: Key text is now bold and shadowed
        * cellwidget.c, keywidget.c, options.c: A new option sets the colors
          scheme based on the theme colors
        * main.c: Added functions to manipulate colors in the HSL color space;
          The color highlight method has been changed to use HSL
        * Makefile.am, singleinstance.c, main.c: Added check to see if the
          program is already running and show the window if it is
        * README: Added recognition printout format from website
        * statusicon.c: Combined statusicon_gtk.c and statusicon_libegg.c into
          one source file.
        * statusicon.c, options.c: Added option to show status icon menu on
          left-click
        * statusicon.c: LibEgg status icon is now sized correctly
        * window.c, keywidget.c, cellwidget.c: Reduced the number of rendering
          calls related to configure events and color changes
        * window.c: Window is no longer allowed to initialize off-screen
        * main.c, window.c, cellwriter.1: Added --window-x, and --window-y
          command line arguments
        * main.c, cellwriter.1, ...: Standardized logging system and partitioned
          into GLib levels. Use --log-level=7 to enable full debug printouts.
          Optionally divert output to a log file with --log-file=PATH.
        * cellwidget.c: Sick of dealing with Xinput issues, disabling by
          default
        * main.c, keyevent.c, cellwriter.1: New command line argument
          --disable-overwrite will prevent modifications to the keymap
        * Revision 1.2.5

2007-10-05  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * statusicon_*: Better error checking
        * main.c, window.c, cellwriter.1: New command line options
          --show-window, --hide-window, --keyboard-only, --profile, and
          --read-only
        * keyevent.c, keys.h, keywidget.c: Key event generation code now
          releases the same KeyCode it pressed regardless of KeySym. Modifier
          locking is now wholly internal. Real lock state and held keys are
          checked and reset before generating any key event.
        * keywidget.c: Lock keys change background color rather than icon.
          Icons are a little larger. 'PSc' key is now Print Screen instead of
          Sys Req. Meta ('Mta') key is now Super key ('Spr').
        * cellwidget.c: Scrollbar-related crash bug fixed
        * stroke.c: A memcpy should have been a memmove
        * window.c, keywidget.c, options.c: Keyboard size is now independent of
          cell size
        * cellwidget.c, keyevent.c: Using XSync() seems to prevent rapidly
          generated key events from interfering with each other. Replaced
          key event generating timeouts with a loop. Should fix Xorg 7.3
          problems as well.
        * Revision 1.2.4

2007-09-24  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>

        * main.c, key_event.c: Error message if Xtest is not supported
        * keyevent.c: Fixed keycode lookup bug related to shifting
        * keyevent.c: Reports keysym used for keycode overwrites
        * keyevent.c, keys.h: Removed KEY_EVENT_AUTO_SHIFT, we always
          auto-shift if we can now
        * keyevent.c: Fixed a nasty bug that prevented KeyCode black-listing
          from working
        * keyevent.c, keywidget.c: Num-lock shows toggle state, numpad keys
          shift properly
        * profile: Added bad KeyCode 245
        * Revision 1.2.3

        * cellwidget.c: Fixed an issue with potential inserts/hold that could
          cause the first point of a stroke to be invalid
        * Revision 1.2.1
        * configure.ac: Missing libgnome is no longer a fatal error, removed
          --disable-xinput (which did nothing anyway)
        * Revision 1.2.2

2007-09-19  Michael Levin  <risujin@risujin.org>
